workflow:
create user:
    * create a new item that is empty
    * create a new ACL entry featuring just the user
    * create item_list_uuid

acl's: 
    * cannot be immutable

post item:
    * POST json object to /content of
        "{ 
            from : "foo@bar.com",
            to : "alias@kobbweb.net" 
                   (or "a0eebc999c0b4ef8bb6d6bb9bd380a11",  // from website
                    or "a0eebc999c0b4ef8bb6d6bb9bd380a11@kobbweb.net", // from email
                    or "")
            data : "[data]"
        }"
        * this hashes the content, stores in data
        * create an item entry
        * by default it assumes parent's ACL_uuid
        * object is added to the database and a uuid is generated
        * if to is an alias then the parent object's uuid is looked up
        * if to is blank then it's added to the user's root_uuid.
